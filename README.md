# Introduction to Cognitive Modeling with ACT-R

Cognitive architectures represent an area of research in general AI that seeks to model the human mind, including how it reasons and adapts to new situations, develops insights and reflects upon itself.  ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rationale) is one such architecture, which provides a set of computational tools to model and predict human behavior for a range of applications in psychology, human-computer interaction, education, and neuroscience.  In this tutorial, participants will learn the basics of ACT-R and how to create their own cognitive models.
